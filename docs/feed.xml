        <title>Building yourself a weather station. Part 2</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;writing-code-for-esp32&quot;&gt;Writing code for ESP32&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.kdubovikov.ml/articles/hardware/build-yourself-a-weather-station&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, we have covered the hardware setup for building a weather station. Starting from now, we will start coding. The first missing piece is the firmware for ESP32.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;Intro&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I live pretty far away from the office, so my commute can take from 2.5 to 4 hours a day ðŸ˜±. That includes a lot of time walking. I lost the count of times when I forgot to check if there was rain when going out from home. Or, even worse, the rain came in when I was midway to the train station. As a plus, the Weather app on my iPhone is not very good at making accurate forecasts. It can easily convince me that there is sunny outside when a sneaky rain starts to drop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of months ago I started diving into the electronics, microcontrollers, and PCBs, so a side-project idea naturally came up to a surface. Iâ€™ll create a simple weather station that will check humidity and temperature outside every morning and notify me if I need to take an umbrella or warm clothes. This is a fun and easy IoT project from the hardware perspective, so I decided to give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this series of posts, we will cover how to build an IoT weather station powered up by a web dashboard and Telegram bot. We will start from the birds-eye view first and cover the architecture of what we are going to make.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The beauty of hardware</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My life is tied to software. I first got interested in it in the year 2001, when I saw my father reading a C++ book. Since then, I learned and built and failed and learned again up to this day. Over those years, Iâ€™ve learned about different programming languages, peeked into the inner workings of operating systems, databases, and compilers. Back in the old days, I have tried to build simple bootloaders and operating systems in assembly using my old PC-iMac clone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, somehow, I have always avoided getting into hardware. How does a CPU work? How RAM stores a single bit of memory? It was all black magic to me. Computers just worked. Maybe, your case is the same as mine. In this post, I will provide a short intro to digital electronics and give you some references on how to advance your studies further.&lt;/p&gt;
