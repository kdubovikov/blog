          <span class="smaller"><i class="far fa-clock"></i> 5 minutes</span><br/>
          <div><h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>I feel that the world of coding is changing. In a couple of years, I expect a lot of new developer tools based on LLMs to come up. They will likely change the way we write code. And maybe even change the definition of what we think is Software Developer. With the release of GPT-4, the ways you can use it in daily programming activities is impressive.</p>

<p>As with any tool, developers should learn how to make a better use of it. While working with LLMs you may notice that some codebases are suited better for them. As powerful as these LLM models are, they have their limitations. One of the primary constraints is their inability to maintain context over long input prompts. This can lead to confusion and misinterpretation when working with large codebases.</p>

<p>More and more people start to think that SDEs will be replaced. My take is that our job might be transformed, but not replaced. More and more developers will likely to be more like software architects and team leads, using LLMs to solve partial tasks and combining final results. LLMs are also pretty bad at correctness and validation, which will most likely remain an important part of our job.</p>

<p>This raises a question: how to write code to be better understood by language models? Let’s dive into LLM-oriented programming.</p>

<p>Some time ago, I hired a software engineer. The interview went fine, but the timeframe was strict and I missed a few questions that I usually ask. We were under heavy pressure, since projects were understaffed and we desperately needed people to keep up with the task stream. The slog of exhaustion, the need for help and a lack of success in hiring for weeks have done their job. I hired someone impulsively.</p>

<h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>

<p>I live pretty far away from the office, so my commute can take from 2.5 to 4 hours a day 😱. That includes a lot of time walking. I lost the count of times when I forgot to check if there was rain when going out from home. Or, even worse, the rain came in when I was midway to the train station. As a plus, the Weather app on my iPhone is not very good at making accurate forecasts. It can easily convince me that there is sunny outside when a sneaky rain starts to drop.</p>

          <div><p>My life is tied to software. I first got interested in it in the year 2001, when I saw my father reading a C++ book. Since then, I learned and built and failed and learned again up to this day. Over those years, I’ve learned about different programming languages, peeked into the inner workings of operating systems, databases, and compilers. Back in the old days, I have tried to build simple bootloaders and operating systems in assembly using my old PC-iMac clone.</p>

<p>Yet, somehow, I have always avoided getting into hardware. How does a CPU work? How RAM stores a single bit of memory? It was all black magic to me. Computers just worked. Maybe, your case is the same as mine. In this post, I will provide a short intro to digital electronics and give you some references on how to advance your studies further.</p>
